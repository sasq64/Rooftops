Rooftops
========

It is another hot summer day, roughly two weeks since the (virtual) end of human kind. You have made your way onto the roof of the building where you work, on lower Manhattan.

More recently, you climbed up on to the ledge of the building, your feet now dangling over the edge, two hundred and twenty feet above ground.

You are trying to work up the courage to jump.
